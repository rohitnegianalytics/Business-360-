## Business model

AtliQ Hardware is a prominent manufacturer that supplies high-quality hardware products to various renowned stores worldwide. Esteemed establishments such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart are among the company's valued customers. These stores, in turn, distribute AtliQ's hardware to end customers, who are the consumers benefiting from their exceptional products.

AtliQ Hardware collaborates with a diverse range of retail platforms, catering to different customer preferences. Croma and BestBuy represent the "Brick and Mortar" category, as they are physical stores, while Amazon and Flipkart fall under the "Ecommerce websites" classification. These platforms serve as crucial channels through which AtliQ's hardware reaches the market, providing options for both in-person and online purchasing.

In addition to the platforms mentioned earlier, there are different channels through which AtliQ Hardware distributes its products. When supplying goods to both Brick and Mortar stores and Ecommerce websites, these customers are referred to as "Retailers." AtliQ also has its own channels, namely AtliQ E-store and AtliQ Exclusive, which are considered "Direct" channels. Another channel type is the "Distributor" category, where AtliQ supplies goods in large shipments to distributors who then sell them to the end consumers.
